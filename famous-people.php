    <p>Franjo Tuđman was the first president of Croatia following its independence in 1991. Born in 1922 in the village of Veliko Trgovišće, near Zagreb, Tuđman was a significant figure in Croatia's modern history. As a historian, he played a vital role in the establishment of Croatian sovereignty after the fall of Yugoslavia. Tuđman was a former communist official who became a staunch nationalist and led the country through the Croatian War of Independence (1991–1995). Under his leadership, Croatia declared independence, and his policies helped shape the future of the newly formed state. Although his presidency was controversial at times, with accusations of authoritarianism, Tuđman is still widely regarded as the father of Croatian independence. He passed away in 1999, but his legacy remains a crucial part of Croatia's history.</p>
